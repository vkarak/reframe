    Concurrent ReFrame processes compete for the database, so a busy backend
    is retried with an exponentially increasing, randomized interval that
    spreads out the retries of the competing writers. If the backend is still
    busy after ``max_retries`` retries, the table is written to a Parquet file
    in ``fallback_dir`` instead, to be imported later. The file is named after
    the session's UUID.

    :arg backend: the :class:`~reframe.analytics.backends.Backend` to append
        to.
    :arg table: the :class:`pyarrow.Table` to append.
    :arg fallback_dir: directory where the Parquet file will be written if the
        retries are exhausted; it is created if it does not exist.
    :arg max_retries: how many times to retry a busy backend.
    :arg base_interval: nominal interval of the first retry in seconds.
    :arg max_interval: upper bound of the nominal retry interval in seconds.
    :returns: the path of the Parquet file written if the retries were
        exhausted, or :obj:`None` if the table was appended to the backend or
        if it had no rows to begin with.
